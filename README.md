# ADINA

This is the package for the ADINA algorithm based on the paper A Adaptive Gradient Algorithm with Momentum based on Spatiotemporal Second-order Dynamical Model by S. Mahboubi, and H. Ninomiya.

ADINA is implemented as an Optimizer object that can be imported and used like any other optimizer (SGD, Adam, etc.). 

Full-batch training example on the 28Ã—28 MNIST dataset and usage explanations are provided.

* [TensorFlow version: 2.18.0](https://github.com/ninomiyalab/ADINA.git)
* [Keras version: 3.8.0]
