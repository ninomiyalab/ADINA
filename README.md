# ADINA

This is the package for the ADINA algorithm based on the paper AAdaptive Gradient Algorithm with Momentum based on Spatiotemporal Second-order Dynamical Model by S. Mahboubi, and H. Ninomiya.

It is currently available for TensorFlow, with implementation based on version 2.10.0 or later.

ADINA is implemented as an Optimizer object that can be imported and used like any other optimizer (SGD, Adam, etc.). Full-batch training examples on the 28Ã—28 MNIST dataset and usage explanations are provided.

* [TensorFlow version: 2.18.0](https://github.com/ninomiyalab/ADINA.git)
* [Keras version: 3.8.0]
